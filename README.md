# Chess Engine model using Pytorch Reinforcement Learning
I created this model for learning purposes and due to limited access to strong hardware I trained bot only for **1000** epochs. 
Model consists of 3 Residual blocks(2 convolutiional layers each) and 2 Fully connected layers with softmax. Model needs to be trained for much more
epochs and can not be evaluated at the moment.
There is room for improvement, for example length of action space can be shortened. Two agent system can be added where model learns by playing as a second player.
My goal was to learn how Reinforcement learning works for such game as chess and create model using Pytorch library, which is new to me.
